# CHANGELOG

## v2.1.0 (2020-12-03)

* Adds Discord support. Now you can send Pullbug messages to a Discord webhook (closes #17)
* Completely rewrote the message module. Messages are now an array of messages built from PR/MR data. This allows messages to be broken up easily into batches for chat services such as Discord which may require multiple batches of messages due to character limit
* The repo name is now included in each message with a link to the repo (closes #16)
* Reworked tests to be more clean and uniform
* Various bug fixes and code refactor for better performance and maintainability

## v2.0.6 (2020-10-10)

* Fixing typo in gitlab message

## v2.0.5 (2020-10-10)

* Fixed bug where arguments weren't being passed properly to the `run_missing_checks` function.
* Beefed up tests to ensure args were being passed to this function

## v2.0.4 (2020-10-10)

* Adding missing `main` entrypoint function that was accidentally deleted during code refactor for v2.0.0

## v2.0.3 (2020-10-10)

* Replaced `logger.warning` with `logger.error` as they were used incorrectly (closes #15)

## v2.0.2 (2020-10-10)

* Correcting references of "Pull Bug" to "Pullbug"

## v2.0.1 (2020-09-30)

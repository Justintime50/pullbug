Pullbug can notify you on Discord or Slack of all open pull requests from GitHub. This tool ensures requests never go unnoticed as it can be setup on a schedule to constantly bug you to merge your work. This is perfect for finding old or stale requests and helps you to stay current on new ones. Pass in a few environment variables, setup a [Slackbot](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace) or [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) webhook and you're all set to be bugged by Pullbug.

**NOTE:** Pullbug works best if you have link unfurling turned off for GitHub on Discord and Slack.

## Install

```bash
# Install tool
pip3 install pullbug

# Install locally

## Usage

Pullbug works best when run on a schedule. Run one-off reports or setup Pullbug to notify you at whatever interval you'd like to be bugged via Discord or Slack about pull requests.

Pullbug is highly customizable allowing you to choose which messaging service and what kinds of pull requests or issues you'd like.

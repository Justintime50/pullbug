Pullbug can notify you on Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat of all open pull and merge requests from GitHub or GitLab. This tool ensures requests never go unnoticed as it can be setup on a schedule to constantly bug you to merge your work. This is perfect for finding old or stale requests and helps you to stay current on new ones. Pass in a few environment variables, setup a [Slackbot](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace) or [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/integration/create/) integration and you're all set to be bugged by Pullbug.

**NOTE:** Pullbug works best if you have link unfurling turned off for GitHub and GitLab on Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat.

**GitLab Users:** If you are not hosting your own GitLab instance and are instead using `gitlab.com`, it's recommended to change the scope to `owner` and provide an owner who has access to all your organizations merge requests.

## Install

```bash
# Install tool
pip3 install pullbug

# Install locally
make install

# Get Makefile help

## Usage

Pullbug works best when run on a schedule. Run one-off reports or setup Pullbug to notify you at whatever interval you'd like to be bugged via Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat about pull or merge requests.

Pullbug is highly customizable allowing you to mix and match version control software along with messaging platforms to get the right fit. Additionally choose which kinds of pull or merge requests to retrieve.

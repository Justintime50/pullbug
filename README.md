Pullbug can notify you on Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat of all open pull requests from GitHub. This tool ensures requests never go unnoticed as it can be setup on a schedule to constantly bug you to merge your work. This is perfect for finding old or stale requests and helps you to stay current on new ones. Pass in a few environment variables, setup a [Slackbot](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace) or [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/integration/create/) integration and you're all set to be bugged by Pullbug.

**NOTE:** Pullbug works best if you have link unfurling turned off for GitHub on Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat.

## Install

```bash
# Install tool
pip3 install pullbug

# Install locally
make install

# Get Makefile help
make help
```

## Usage

Pullbug works best when run on a schedule. Run one-off reports or setup Pullbug to notify you at whatever interval you'd like to be bugged via Discord, Slack, or Rocket.Chat about pull requests.

Pullbug is highly customizable allowing you to mix and match version control software along with messaging platforms to get the right fit. Additionally choose which kinds of pull requests to retrieve.
